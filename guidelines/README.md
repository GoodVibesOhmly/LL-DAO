## Challenge Areas

In each Challenge Area, we consider a wide solution spectrum â€” including blockchain code, contract law, and good faith social conventions. We consider both theoretical legal principles as well as actual laws in particular jurisdictions.

1.  **Formation**

    -   Derive legal formation documents from the DAO's code and *vice versa*.

    -   Automate legal agreement execution via cryptographic signing and hashing.

    -   Record automated legal agreements on-chain and in state registrars when required.

2.  **Maintenance**

    -   How do human person(s) effectively assume the DAO's administrative roles?

    -   How do third parties effectively assume roles such as the DAO's lawyers and accountants?

    -   How can we ensure alignment between the DAO and its surrogate(s)?

3.  **Contracts**

    -   How can the DAO enter into legally binding agreements with customers and participants?

    -   Arbitration: how are disputes with (and within) the DAO resolved?

    -   Liquidated Damages: what remedies are available when the DAO breaches an agreement?

4.  **Liability**

    -   How are ordinary business liabilities handled by the DAO and its participants?

    -   What about criminal liability for participants?

5.  **Tax**

    -   Recommended tax structure (i.e., what elections to make)?

    -   How should the DAO account for and pay taxes?

6.  **Property**

    -   How does the DAO manage off-chain assets?

    -   Tangibles: real property, machinery, equipment?

    -   Intangibles: IP, software licenses, domains?

7.  **Profit Distributions & Tokenization**

    -   Determine and encode ownership/governance rights of the DAO's Members

    -   How can the DAO tokenize its membership or profit interests in a compliant way?
