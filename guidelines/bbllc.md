Recently, dOrg incorporated in Vermont as a BBLLC. This legal structure
allows a DAO to operate as a legal entity. Additional information and
background can be seen here:
[https://github.com/dOrgTech/LL-DAO](https://github.com/dOrgTech/LL-DAO).
Below are answers to various questions you might have regarding the dOrg
incorporation process:

-   What is the background of dOrg?

    -   dOrg is structured as a cooperative of freelancers, created to enjoy economies of scale while maintaining freelancer independence. dOrg started as a spinoff of the [Genesis DAO](https://medium.com/daostack/tagged/genesis-dao) community around December, and developed a business model to fund themselves through client software development work, helping companies & teams with [DAOstack](https://daostack.io/) integrations.

-   Why should a DAO incorporate?

    -   [Limited Liability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limited_liability): There's a big issue with debt and other legal liabilities for unincorporated DAOs. As an unincorporated entity, any member could create debts for the entire collective. This exposes every member to debts & liabilities caused by any other member, which is not a good thing.

    -   [Legal Capacity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capacity_(law)): In addition, unincorporated DAOs have a hard time entering into legal agreements with existing legal entities. Incorporating gives the DAO the ability to enter into legal contracts, to sue and to be sued.

-   How long did dOrg's legal process take?

    -   2-3 months

    -   During this time, dOrg and its legal advisors worked out a lot of details that other projects might not need to work out now. Learned a lot that should make process for new teams easier and less expensive.

    -   An entity can be registered through Vermont's online portal in as little as 1-3 business days.

-   What were dOrg's objectives?

    -   Limited Liability, Legal Capacity

        -   Shield members from personal liability

            -   Not liable for other members' actions

            -   Not liable for the entity's debts

            -   Personal assets are not at risk

        -   Fluidly interoperate with other individuals and legal
            > entities

            -   Allow contributors to come and go

            -   Give other legal entities (Clients, Partners, & Service Providers) a point of contact for financial agreements

    -   Minimize admin overhead (paperwork, fees, official titles, board meetings, lawyers, accountants) and any interfacing with legal docs/system

        -   Handle all potentially contentious processes on-chain

        -   Including the processes for changing processes

        -   No need to update documents as new members are added or removed

-   What are dOrg's Ownership / Governance goals?

    -   dOrg aimed to give its worker-members full control of the entity in a meritocratic, non-hierarchical fashion. The more value a member contributes to the company, the higher their reputation (voting power).

    -   As for ownership, dOrg is currently owned entirely by its worker-members. Revenues that come into the entity are allocated over time through proposals to members, contractors, and third party service providers.

-   Does dOrg's legal entity have shareholders?

    -   The owners of an LLC are referred to as "Members". Currently there are no external investor owners, only worker-members

    -   Anyone with any amount of Rep is considered to have 1 share of the company

-   Can the BBLLC issue out dividends?

    -   Shares are not considered a means of profit-sharing. In dOrg's case, the entity is designed to be zero-profit. The LLC itself won't pay taxes because there won't be profits. The only way to get money out of the DAO is through proposals.

-   Does the legal entity have a board of directors?

    -   No it does not. The reputation holders are the ultimate decision-makers. Nothing above or beyond that.

-   Who would represent this legal entity in court?

    -   dOrg can define administrative member(s) to act as a centralized point of contact for formal roles such as filing legal documents, maintaining a mailing address, appearing in court, etc. Members have the ability to update who this person is at any time.

-   Is there KYC requirements for the DAO?

    -   US LLCs don't have KYC requirements for owners. Ownership can be completely anonymous.

    -   The only thing you need identifying information for is taxes, so you'd only need that to issue the [1099s](https://www.debt.org/small-business/what-are-1099s/) to people the DAO is paying.

    -   For customers of the DAO, it has to follow the same guidelines that any other business would when dealing with customers.

-   Are there any restrictions on who dOrg is able to work with?

    -   Just like a normal corporation, dOrg needs a tax ID of businesses it deals with.

    -   Corporations from countries that the US has trade sanctions on would not be able to do business with dOrg at this time.

-   What are the roles within dOrg's DAO?

    -   Contractors - get paid by the DAO (agree to *Contractor Terms & Conditions*)

    -   Members - hold reputation in the DAO (agree to [Operating Agreement](https://app.openlaw.io/template/bbllc-dao%20-%20vermont))

    -   Customers - pay the DAO (agree to *Customer Terms & Conditions*)

-   What happens if someone steals from the DAO?

    -   If someone attempts to defraud the DAO or breach existing agreements, then there is legal recourse to sue.

-   Can a DAO incorporate in any other States other than Vermont?

    -   Technically, yes. See here for an example of a [New York LLC-DAO](https://app.openlaw.io/template/llc-dao%20operating%20agreement%20(ny)).

    -   Vermont explicitly created legislation to create a new legal entity classification called the BBLLC, that permits companies to manage governance, ownership and conduct material operations on a blockchain. This provides certainty that other jurisdictions lack.

    -   The risk in incorporating in another State is that the legal system may not have categories or accept the legitimacy of the DAO governance decisions.

-   Does the DAO need to file taxes?

    -   Just like any other company, dOrg needs to file taxes

    -   Members will pay self-employment taxes according to their own jurisdictions

-   Are your incorporation documents publicly available?

    -   Yes, they are [here](https://app.openlaw.io/template/bbllc-dao%20-%20vermont).

-   What is the benefit of LLC?

    -   Super lightweight

    -   Low admin requirements (annual report)

-   What are possible variations in these legal documents that might be popular?

    -   dOrg spent months fine-tuning all the legal agreements so that full power would be vested in the reputation holders as dictated by the community governance engine (DAOstack's Alchemy Earth).

    -   LLCs are very flexible, so any variations to the above could be specified in an entity's formation documents (Operating Agreement)

    -   dOrg also chose to use DAOstack, but this approach could work for any DAO-like protocol if explained properly in the formation documents.

-   Do you recommend people using these legal documents as-is?

    -   No, these documents are meant to serve as a useful starting point for others, but each DAO will have its own design goals and considerations.

    -   If interested in speaking with us about the technical, economic or legal aspects of starting your own DAO, feel free to contact dOrg on [Discord](https://discord.gg/6Kujmad) or at contact@dorg.tech.

-   Are there any challenges you are currently running into?

    -   UX for maintenance / operational / admin activities

        -   For example, a new client comes on and signs new service agreement with them. Right now, this would require putting a document in github, then create proposal to pass it within alchemy

    -   Requiring a bank account to receive payments from other traditional corporations

-   Next steps

    -   Software, templates, and guidelines to make legal DAO formation and maintenance easier.
