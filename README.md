# LL-DAO
> Guidelines, templates and tooling for forming and operating Limited Liability DAOs (LL-DAOs).

Background
----------

Around the world, researchers and practitioners are exploring the problem of interfacing blockchain-based organizations (DAOs) with legacy legal systems.

In July, 2018 Vermont enacted Act 205, which permits limited liability companies to manage governance, ownership and conduct material
operations on a blockchain [[1]](https://www.coindesk.com/vermontdao-state-governor-signs-bill-clearing-way-blockchain-companies)[[2]](https://legislature.vermont.gov/statutes/section/11/025/04173)[[3]](https://jimhamiltonblog.blogspot.com/2018/06/vermont-permits-llcs-to-operate.html).

This new legal entity classification, the blockchain-based LLC (BBLLC), provides a model to begin designing and testing DAO legal wrappers in the wild. If properly utilized, such novel frameworks could empower DAOs to fluidly interoperate with the existing legal system while shielding participants from ordinary business liabilities.

Overview
--------

This research probes a live case-study of a BBLLC-linked DAO. In doing so, we hope to address open research questions regarding the design and viability of DAOs with traditional legal standing. We also hope to highlight insights from this exercise that will allow lawmakers to iterate and improve upon blockchain regulatory frameworks like the BBLLC.

The collaboration centers on two core objectives:

1.  *Launch a pilot LL-DAO*

       - [X] **Form and deploy a Limited Liability DAO** as a Vermont BBLLC under the guidance of local advisors who assisted with development of Act 205.

       - [X] **Prepare the legal agreements and operational processes** necessary for the DAO to legitimately conduct business activities and manage its core operations through persistent blockchain programs (Smart Contracts).

2.  *Develop resources for LL-DAO formation and maintenance*

       - [ ] **[Guidelines](guidelines)** that address all Challenge Areas.

       - [ ] **[Template Library](templates)** of useful legal agreements.

       - [ ] **[Tooling](tooling)** for automating formation and maintenance workflows.

### Goals

*Adapted from [CL+B Fest 2019](https://legalhackers.org/clbfest2019-resources/) DISCUSS tracks*

-   How can regulatory sandboxes be used to test and advance the blockchain regulatory space?

-   How might the co-op model further blockchain governance?

-   Is there a legal entity type for a DAO that wouldn't take away that DAO's fundamental properties?

*Adapted from [COALA](https://coala.global/working-groups/) 'Alegality' working group*

-   Legal Avatars -- create legal representatives, surrogates, delegates, and/or custodians for various functions of blockchain-based systems

-   Support interactions between DAOs and the legal world --

    -   Identify the limitations of current forms of interactions with the legal world

    -   Elaborate new mechanisms e.g., decentralized insurance, contract and property APIs

-   DAO Governance -- enforcement mechanisms and underlying ethics of code-based rules
